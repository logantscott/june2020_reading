### Reading, Research, and Discussion
1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
1. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
1. What is one downside of Test Driven Development
1. What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
1. Name a use case for a static method
1. Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves


### Vocabulary
**functional programming**  
The process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through *pure functions*.

**pure function**  
1. Its return value is the same for the same arguments (no variation with local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input streams from I/O devices).
1. Its evaluation has no side effects (no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or I/O streams).

**higher-order function**  
A function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function. Higher order function is in contrast to first order functions, which don’t take a function as an argument or return a function as output.

**immutable state**  
State that cannot be changed.

**object**  
In *object-oriented programming (OOP)*, is an abstract data type created by a developer. It can include multiple properties and methods and may even contain other objects. In most programming languages, objects are defined as *classes*.

**object-oriented programming (OOP)**  
Refers to a programming methodology based on *objects*, instead of just functions and procedures. These *objects* are organized into *classes*, which allow individual *objects* to be grouped together.

**class**  
Used in *object-oriented programming* to describe one or more objects. It serves as a template for creating, or instantiating, specific objects within a program. While each object is created from a single class, one class can be used to instantiate multiple objects.

**prototype**  
In JavaScript, the JavaScript engine adds a prototype property to the function. This prototype property is an object (called a prototype object) that has a constructor property by default. The constructor property points back to the function on which prototype object is a property. A function's prototype property can be accessed using *functionName.prototype*.

**super**  


**inheritance**  


**constructor**  


**instance**  


**context**  


**this**  


**Test Driven Development (TDD)**  


**Jest**  


**Continuous Integration (CI)**  
Automatically build and test your code as you push it to GitHub, preventing bugs from being deployed to production.

**unit test**
