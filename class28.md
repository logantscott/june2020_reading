## Hooks API

### Architectural Design & React

This is breaking down the two common architectural design with React - functional vs class-components, and how that works with layered architectures.

### Components

#### Container
These components handle how data is moved between the client and server, how state is managed, and services to handle requests.

#### Presentation
These components mainly contain the UI, or how the page looks to the user (HTML, CSS).
