## MVC

### Simplified  
#### Model: Data  
#### View: UI  
#### Controller: Logic  

### Notes  
The strange thing about what I've read about MVC is that it's more about separating presentation and domain, meaning seperating the model from the view and the logic. 

## 4 Layer SPAs  

### View  
Presentational and container components, takes state and such and pushes UI
### Application Services  
Things like API calls and some simple state updates
### Store  
State, publisher and subscriber
### Domain  
Basically models
