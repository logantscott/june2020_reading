## MVVM

Model - View - ViewModel

View is presentational

ViewModel receives input from view, sends it to model, receives data back from model (if any), and updates the view.

Model is stuff like routes and data store.

I struggle to understand exactly what data binding is and how MVVM differs from MVP. My understanding is that MVVM will update when state changes regardless if the user initiated the change.
