## Custom Hooks

I am still unclear on the logic of how custom hooks work from looking at them, but it seems they are good for sharing stateful logic between multiple components. 

Custom hooks should start with the 'use' keyword and effects are isolated to the calling component.

I read one comment saying that custom hooks 'finally allow' us to do all the things we can do with class components, so I can't help but wonder why they're trying so hard to make functional work for certain use cases when class components already work.
